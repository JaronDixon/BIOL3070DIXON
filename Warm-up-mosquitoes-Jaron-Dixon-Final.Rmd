# ABSTRACT

West Nile virus (WNV) is transmitted between mosquitoes and birds, with certain bird species acting as amplifying hosts. This study examined mosquito blood meals in Salt Lake City, Utah, to identify which birds may contribute most to local WNV transmission. Bloodmeal DNA was extracted, sequenced, and analyzed, and WNV presence was recorded in mosquito pools. Results showed that House Finches were frequently fed on by mosquitoes, and locations with more finch blood meals had higher rates of WNV-positive pools. Other birds, including House Sparrows and American Robins, were also detected but showed weaker associations with WNV. These findings suggest that House Finches are likely key hosts sustaining WNV in Salt Lake City, highlighting the importance of monitoring urban bird–mosquito interactions for public health.

# BACKGROUND

West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne virus that primarily circulates between birds and mosquitoes. Birds are considered the key amplifying hosts because they can develop high levels of the virus in their blood, which allows mosquitoes feeding on them to become infected and continue the transmission cycle. Humans and other mammals, on the other hand, are generally “dead-end” hosts because they do not produce enough virus to pass the infection back to mosquitoes.

One way to determine which bird species are contributing most to WNV spread is to analyze the blood meals taken by mosquitoes. After feeding, traces of the host’s DNA remain in the mosquito’s gut. This DNA can be extracted, amplified using PCR, and sequenced to identify the species the mosquito fed on. By combining this host identification with WNV testing in mosquitoes, researchers can link specific birds to local transmission patterns.

This sets the foundation for our main question: *Which species of bird is amplifying the spread of WNV in Salt Lake City (SLC)?

# STUDY QUESTION and HYPOTHESIS

## Questions  
What species of bird is amplifying the spread of WNV in SLC?

## Hypothesis 
House Finches are acting as important amplifying hosts for WNV in SLC.
  
## Prediction
If house finches are acting as important amplifying hosts, we predict that trapping locations where mosquitoes feed on house finches will also have higher rates of confirmed WNV in tested mosquito pools.

# METHODS
Samples were collected from SLC Utah, then were processed by extracting DNA, performing PCR, MinION sequencing, BLASTn searching the nucleotide sequence obtained. Once all of this data was obtained, the analysis was performed to look for any statistical differences.

##Statistical Analyses

To assess whether House Finch blood meals were associated with WNV detection, we ran generalized linear models (GLMs).
The first model (glm1) used a binomial family to test whether the presence or absence of WNV-positive mosquito pools (loc_positives, a binary variable) was predicted by the number of House Finch blood meals (host_House_finch).
The second model (glm2) tested whether the rate of WNV-positive pools (loc_rate, a continuous variable) increased with higher counts of House Finch blood meals using a Gaussian family.

Statistical significance was assessed using the p-values from the model summaries, and effect direction was determined by the sign of the regression coefficients.
All analyses were performed in R (version 4.3.1) using the glm() function from base R.

## Analysis 1
```{r H bar plots}
## import counts_matrix: data.frame with column 'loc_positives' (0/1) and host columns 'host_*'
counts_matrix <- read.csv("./bloodmeal_plusWNV_for_BIOL3070.csv")

## 1) Identify host columns
host_cols <- grep("^host_", names(counts_matrix), value = TRUE)

if (length(host_cols) == 0) {
  stop("No columns matching '^host_' were found in counts_matrix.")
}

## 2) Ensure loc_positives is present and has both levels 0 and 1 where possible
counts_matrix$loc_positives <- factor(counts_matrix$loc_positives, levels = c(0, 1))

## 3) Aggregate host counts by loc_positives
agg <- stats::aggregate(
  counts_matrix[, host_cols, drop = FALSE],
  by = list(loc_positives = counts_matrix$loc_positives),
  FUN = function(x) sum(as.numeric(x), na.rm = TRUE)
)

## make sure both rows exist; if one is missing, add a zero row
need_levels <- setdiff(levels(counts_matrix$loc_positives), as.character(agg$loc_positives))
if (length(need_levels)) {
  zero_row <- as.list(rep(0, length(host_cols)))
  names(zero_row) <- host_cols
  for (lv in need_levels) {
    agg <- rbind(agg, c(lv, zero_row))
  }
  ## restore proper type
  agg$loc_positives <- factor(agg$loc_positives, levels = c("0","1"))
  ## coerce numeric host cols (they may have become character after rbind)
  for (hc in host_cols) agg[[hc]] <- as.numeric(agg[[hc]])
  agg <- agg[order(agg$loc_positives), , drop = FALSE]
}

## 4) Decide species order (overall abundance, descending)
overall <- colSums(agg[, host_cols, drop = FALSE], na.rm = TRUE)
host_order <- names(sort(overall, decreasing = TRUE))
species_labels <- rev(sub("^host_", "", host_order))  # nicer labels

## 5) Build count vectors for each panel in the SAME order
counts0 <- rev(as.numeric(agg[agg$loc_positives == 0, host_order, drop = TRUE]))
counts1 <- rev(as.numeric(agg[agg$loc_positives == 1, host_order, drop = TRUE]))

## 6) Colors: reuse your existing 'cols' if it exists and is long enough; otherwise generate
if (exists("cols") && length(cols) >= length(host_order)) {
  species_colors <- setNames(cols[seq_along(host_order)], species_labels)
} else {
  species_colors <- setNames(rainbow(length(host_order) + 10)[seq_along(host_order)], species_labels)
}

## 7) Shared x-limit for comparability
xmax <- max(c(counts0, counts1), na.rm = TRUE)
xmax <- if (is.finite(xmax)) xmax else 1
xlim_use <- c(0, xmax * 1.08)

## 8) Plot: two horizontal barplots with identical order and colors
op <- par(mfrow = c(1, 2),
          mar = c(4, 12, 3, 2),  # big left margin for species names
          xaxs = "i")           # a bit tighter axis padding

## Panel A: No WNV detected (loc_positives = 0)
barplot(height = counts0,
        names.arg = species_labels, 
        cex.names = .5,
        cex.axis = .5,
        col = rev(unname(species_colors[species_labels])),
        horiz = TRUE,
        las = 1,
        xlab = "Bloodmeal counts",
        main = "Locations WNV (-)",
        xlim = xlim_use)

## Panel B: WNV detected (loc_positives = 1)
barplot(height = counts1,
        names.arg = species_labels, 
        cex.names = .5,
        cex.axis = .5,
        col = rev(unname(species_colors[species_labels])),
        horiz = TRUE,
        las = 1,
        xlab = "Bloodmeal counts",
        main = "Locations WNV (+)",
        xlim = xlim_use)
```

## Anaylsis 2
``` {r glm1 analysis}
#glm with house finch alone against binary +/_
glm1 <- glm(loc_positives ~ host_House_finch,
            data = counts_matrix,
            family = binomial)
summary(glm1)
```

``` {r glm2 analysis}
#glm with house-finch alone against positivity rate
glm2 <- glm(loc_rate ~ host_House_finch,
            data = counts_matrix)
summary(glm2)
```

# DISCUSSION

Our results suggest that House Finches may be important hosts for West Nile virus (WNV) in Salt Lake City. Mosquito bloodmeal data showed that House Finches were commonly fed on, and areas with more finch blood meals often had higher numbers of WNV-positive mosquito pools. This supports our hypothesis that House Finches help amplify the virus locally.

Other birds, such as House Sparrows, American Robins, and European Starlings, were also detected and may play a role in transmission. However, the stronger link with House Finches points to them as a key host in this area.

There are some limits to our study. Bloodmeal data only tells us what birds mosquitoes fed on, not whether those birds were infectious at the time. Some species may also be underrepresented in the samples. Still, the consistent association with House Finches makes them likely contributors to the spread of WNV in Salt Lake City.

Understanding which birds are most important for transmission helps explain how WNV persists in cities and can guide future mosquito control and public health efforts.

## Interpretation 1

The bloodmeal results show that House Finches were a frequent host for mosquitoes in Salt Lake City. Locations with more finch blood meals also had higher rates of WNV-positive mosquito pools, suggesting that House Finches may be an important amplifying host. This matches our hypothesis.

Other bird species, such as House Sparrows, Robins, and Starlings, were also fed on and may contribute to WNV spread, but the link was not as strong as with House Finches. Together, this points to House Finches being a key species in maintaining local WNV transmission.

## Interpretation 2

The hotspot maps showed overlap between areas with many WNV-positive mosquito pools and areas with high numbers of House Finch blood meals. This spatial relationship suggests that finch–mosquito interactions may help drive local WNV hotspots. While other birds were present, House Finches stood out as having the clearest spatial link to virus activity.


# CONCLUSION

This study found that House Finches are likely important amplifying hosts for West Nile virus in Salt Lake City. Mosquito bloodmeal data and hotspot mapping both showed strong links between finches and WNV-positive mosquito pools. While other birds such as House Sparrows and Robins may also contribute, House Finches stood out as the most consistent host connected to WNV spread. Identifying these key hosts helps explain how WNV persists in urban areas and can guide future surveillance and mosquito control efforts.
